Research Projects
======
*(Switching to first person :)*

I am actively involved in a wide range of research projects as part of my roles at the Machine Learning section and Data Science Lab of University of Copenhagen. Brief descriptions of ongoing and completed projects are listed below.

Ongoing projects 
---

* **COVID-19 Risk Modelling**: 
As part of a collaboration with the hospitals in Zealand region of Denmark, we are modelling COVID-19 risk from [clinical](https://raghavian.github.io/publication/2020-10-COVID) and image data. I am contributing to the team focusing on [using chest X-rays](https://raghavian.github.io/publication/2020-01-01-Lung-Segmentation-from-Chest-X-rays-using-Variational-Data-Imputation) at admission to model risk of COVID-19.

* **Uncertainty Quantification**:
Medical image segmentation with well calibrated and meaningful uncertainty estimation can be more useful in clinical settings. For example, we present a [probabilistic segmentation model](https://raghavian.github.io/publication/2020-07-uqFlow) that uses normalizing flows to improve the diversity of segmented samples.

* **Low Resource Machine Learning**:
Reducing the reliance on high quality labeled data and expensive hardware resources can globally democratise ML methods. Addressing one of these factors,  we recently introduced [tensor networks for medical image classification](https://raghavian.github.io/publication/2020-01-01-Tensor-Networks-for-Medical-Image-Classification) tasks that require less than 10% of GPU resources when compared to traditional deep learning models. We have also put out a tool -- [Carbontracker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03051) -- to predict and track carbon footprint of developing deep learning models, in an effort to encourage research into energy-efficient models.

* **Locomotion analysis**:
In this collabortion with [Kiehn Lab](https://in.ku.dk/research/ole-kiehn/), my role has been to analyze videos of mice running on treadmills in order to extract speed, cadence and coordination statistics. The results from analyzing some 1000 videos have accentuated the role of [specific interneurons in the spinal cord that influence locomotion](https://raghavian.github.io/publication/2020-01-01-Locomotor-deficits-in-ALS-mice-are-paralleled-by-loss-of-V1-interneuron-connections-onto-fast-motor-neurons).

* **Generative Modelling of nanoparticles**: 
Obtaining structures from scattering data for nanomolecules turns out to be an expensive and difficult task. This ongoing collaboration with [Prof. Kirsten Jensenâ€™s group](https://chem.ku.dk/ansatte/alle/?pure=en/persons/540779) we are explorting generating valid nanomolecular structures from x-ray scattering data using deep generative models with [promising early results](https://raghavian.github.io/publication/2020-07-characterisingAtomicStrucs).

* **Behavioural analysis of narwhals**: 
Echolocation used by narwhals can reveal their behaviour. In this collaboration with [Prof. Susanne Ditlevsen's group](http://web.math.ku.dk/~susanne/), we are using machine learning methods to characterise the [foraging behaviour of narwhals from accelerometer data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01992).
