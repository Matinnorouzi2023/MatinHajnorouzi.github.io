Research Projects
======
*(Switching to first person :)*

I am actively involved in a wide range of research projects as part of my roles at the Machine Learning section and Data Science Lab of University of Copenhagen. Brief descriptions of ongoing and completed projects are listed below.

Ongoing projects 
---
* **Low Resource Machine Learning**:
Reducing the reliance on high quality labeled data and expensive hardware resources can globally democratise ML methods. Addressing one of these factors,  we recently introduced [tensor networks for medical image classification](https://raghavian.github.io/publication/2020-01-01-Tensor-Networks-for-Medical-Image-Classification) tasks that require less than 10% of GPU resources when compared to traditional deep learning models. We have also put out a tool -- [Carbontracker](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.03051) -- to predict and track carbon footprint of developing deep learning models, in an effort to encourage research into energy-efficient models.

* **AIChemy: Generative Modelling of nanoparticles**: 
Obtaining structures from scattering data for nanomolecules turns out to be an expensive and difficult task. This ongoing collaboration with [Prof. Kirsten Jensenâ€™s group](https://chem.ku.dk/ansatte/alle/?pure=en/persons/540779) we are explorting generating valid nanomolecular structures from x-ray scattering data using deep generative models with [promising early results](https://raghavian.github.io/publication/2020-07-characterisingAtomicStrucs).

* **Locomotion analysis**:
In this collabortion with [Kiehn Lab](https://in.ku.dk/research/ole-kiehn/), my role has been to analyze videos of mice running on treadmills in order to extract speed, cadence and coordination statistics. The results from analyzing some 1000 videos have accentuated the role of [specific interneurons in the spinal cord that influence locomotion](https://raghavian.github.io/publication/2020-01-01-Locomotor-deficits-in-ALS-mice-are-paralleled-by-loss-of-V1-interneuron-connections-onto-fast-motor-neurons).

* **Sustainable neuroimaging**:
As the Chair of the SEA-SIG [Neuroimaging Research Working Group](https://neuropipelines.github.io/), a team within SEA-SIG, I am leading an international team of 15 colleagues. This volunteer team is dedicated to the carbon footprinting of neuroimaging pipelines, and generation of best practice guidance. 

* **Quantifying insect biodiversity**: In this ongoing collaboration with [FaunaPhotonics](https://www.faunaphotonics.com/), we are attempting unsupervised clustering of insects based on optically recorded signals from field data. An [initial attempt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05526) involved using a variational autoencoder that dynamically adjusts the tradeoff between reconstruction and regularisation terms.

* **Uncertainty Quantification**:
Medical image segmentation with well calibrated and meaningful uncertainty estimation can be more useful in clinical settings. For example, we present a [probabilistic segmentation model](https://raghavian.github.io/publication/2020-07-uqFlow) that uses normalizing flows to improve the diversity of segmented samples.

Completed projects

*  **COVID-19 Risk Modelling** (2020-2021): Collaboration with hospitals in Zealand region of DK. [pub1](https://raghavian.github.io/publication/2020-10-COVID) [pub2](https://raghavian.github.io/publication/2020-01-01-Lung-Segmentation-from-Chest-X-rays-using-Variational-Data-Imputation)
* **Behavioural analysis of narwhals** (2021): [Collaboration as part of Data Science Lab](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.01992)
* **Segmentation of roots in soil** (2019): [Collaboration with Plant & Environ. Science Dept.](https://raghavian.github.io/publication/2019-01-01-Segmentation-of-roots-in-soil-with-U-Net)
* **Extraction of airways from volumetric data** (2018): [PhD Thesis](https://raghavian.github.io/publication/2018-01-01-Extraction-of-Airways)
* **Bayesian tracking of multiple point targets** (2015): [MSc Thesis](https://raghavian.github.io/publication/2015-01-01-Bayesian-tracking-EM)
* **India's first pico-satellite** (2010): [Collaboration with Indian Space Research Organisation](https://earth.esa.int/web/eoportal/satellite-missions/s/studsat-1)

<!-- * **COVID-19 Risk Modelling**: 
#As part of a collaboration with the hospitals in Zealand region of Denmark, we are modelling COVID-19 risk from [clinical](https://raghavian.github.io/publication/2020-10-COVID) and image data. I am contributing to the team focusing on [using chest X-rays](https://raghavian.github.io/publication/2020-01-01-Lung-Segmentation-from-Chest-X-rays-using-Variational-Data-Imputation) at admission to model risk of COVID-19.
