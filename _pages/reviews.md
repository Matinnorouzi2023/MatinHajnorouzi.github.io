Peer-reviewing is important to keep maintain scientific standards and to contribute to the research community. I also use it as an opportunity to read and keep abrest with new work. However, in the current Machine Learning research climate the reviewing load is quite hectic and takes up a considerable amount of my work time. In this page, I will maintain a count of all the reviewing I have done/will do to account for my time.
